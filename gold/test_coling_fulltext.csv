jjfoxy Iraq and Syria are not Saudi Arabia. I have lived int hat region for 15 years. Iraqis and Syrians were among the most secular Arabs - women wore western clothes, many people were well educated. They definitely know more about westerners, than westerners know about them. For example, if taking care of your children is a requirement to be a good father, Saudi men are better fathers than Canadian or American men, about half of whom abandon their kids before birth (42 percent of children born in the US are to single mothers. No daddies around)

I'll bite. What could we have done about Syria? Depose Assad? You think that this wouldn't have led to chaos? Who would have taken over? Could we support Assad? No. The only thing we could do in Syria is stay away. Whatever else we do would achieve nothing. Look at the blood and treasure wasted in Afghanistan. We went there with the best intention, along with a big NATO force, spent many billions, lost some of Canada's best, and what was achieved?? Syria, the Middle East, and all the craziness that flows from there has nothing to do with Canada, and we don't wan to bring it here, to our civil and peaceful and productive nation.

Cultured liberal societies are struggling with a refugee Convention that was produced after the Second World War. Terrorism was unknown then. Another Convention is urgently required in 2015 to tackle the current situation. Spewing inconsiderate comments are not going to solve the problem. It is a human catastrophe in the making; human smuggling should not be made a lucrative trade; Paris cannot wait for another set of rioters - Europeans must deal with it immediately. Australia is protected by the vast Indian Ocean, unlike the Mediterranean; not good to compare and contrast. On the lighter side, it will always have a better chance of finding a refugee boat than that Malaysian aircraft. In the Mediterranean, they are in from of you; what you do; take them back to Libya?

Mr Simpson attempts to document the tsunami of migration now underway from over a dozen countries and destined to grow much higher for years to come. Long standing religious and ethnic civil wars being the main reason, ill-advised western interventions secondary, global warming laughable. But his analysis is incomplete. Left-lib sanctimony is now running wild. Political correctness takes the place of rational thought and honest opinion. When the premier of Hungary simply states that his people have the nerve to want to remain Hungarian. To be Christian in heritage and democratic in government. The effete yell 'reactionary, natavist, racism'. Many pleaders say let them in but refuse to say how many. Can there be any doubt that absent transportation limitations it would be in the tens of millions. The effective dismantling of the German border by Frau Merkel has encouraged mass migration indirectly resulting in the deaths of hundreds/thousands - leaving safe havens and clamoring into over crowed scows and dinghys for an ocean voyage, chanting 'Germany Germany' until they capsize. The left and the smugglers commend her action. Harper's thoughtful considered approach is best for all concerned. The Toronto media need to get a grip and call for the rich Muslim Gulf states to step up. It's their backyard. This problem will not be solved by Europe and N America alone.

Merkle says this morning that they cannot handle any more. Then why did she open her silly mouth. Trying to run a country on emotion always leads to disaster. What I want does not matter.

I suspect there may be a bright side of this coin in that more well trained, well educated Europeans may just be applying to immigrate to Canada to get away from the refugees and all that they bring to the table there.

There are 5 million Muslims in France and 3 of them committed this act, and there are probably at most 1000 people under surveillance. Painting the entire community with the same brush is a bit excessive. France has close to 70 million people, and last year only about 655 died from violence (murder, attacks, etc...).Compare that to the United States, with about 5 times the population (350 million) had 15 000 deaths from violence. France would have to have had 3000 murders to be equivalent. Also, this is home-grown terrorism, and France is still a much much much safer country that our neighbour to the south. Yes, France has a problem, but the radicalization of Muslim youths is largely due to the failure of the state to properly integrate immigrants, a problem that most other western countries also have, be it with Muslims or any other large immigrant population. It's the exact same issue that caused the 2 attacks we recently had in Canada. Furthermore, 'religious' terrorism is not unique to Islam, let's not forget the 'troubles' between Catholics and Protestants in Ireland and England. That conflict killed more than 3500 people, injured over 47,000 people and caused billions in damage and economic mayhem - and it happened in supposed modern and ordered countries such as Ireland and the U.K.What do you expect from Muslims youths. They are marginalized in the countries they were born in, they don't feel welcomed or belong. Their countries of origin are either run by Western supported dictatorships and always being bombed or invaded (for oil) by the United States and its allies.",jje,test_id_31

The border with Austria was demarcated by two rows of barbed wire fences in a strip devoid of any tall vegetation. Uncle Joe loomed large in a massive sculpture of him and Czech communists in the heart of Prague. In order to bring the family gifts such as chewing gum and 'decent' cigarettes, my dad had to buy foreign exchange certificates beforehand and then go shopping at a special department store the average citizen had no access to.One of my uncles, who was looking forward to a teaching career had become a disillusioned, alcoholic labourer as his refusal to join the Communist Party barred him from teaching. One of my cousins grew up to take an engineering degree but there were no jobs. My parents had to send money for years to help with home improvements and things we took for granted. Even my high school graduation suit was sent off to one of the boys. Jump forward to 1996: The barbed wire was gone, the Stalin statue was gone, Prague was bustling with commerce and tourism. The communist drabness had been dispelled. On the family front, my alcoholic uncle was still bitter. My cousin's husband, a former manager at Skoda motor works, now owned a ball-bearing import and distribution business. He had many customers, a couple competitors and was prosperous enough to buy and renovate a large house in which he has his business office. He and his friends could now afford vacations on the Slovenian coast, which they took as a group. My cousin still had no engineering job but was a sales rep for a small French pharmaceutical company, nevertheless not entirely secure. In short, it was like night and day. With the amicable divorce from Slovakia, the Czech Republic was re-established as the European nation it aspired to be after WWI and the brief years between Naziism and Communism.",jje,test_id_51

I agree with you that in terms of money being sent is a wasted effort and is not the solution and more needs to be done to help the developing countries. And how does one do that? Unfortunately the best way is to close out borders to the ones fleeing distress in their countries. This might seem cruel, but think about it for a moment. We are taking in people with more or less similar morals and values as Western countries, which might seem like a noble thing to do, but at the same time less of those people are now in these impoverished countries to turn them around for the better. Sometimes short term pain is good for long term gain.

?European law says that every refugee is entitled to asylum. But nobody can agree on who?s responsible for the asylum seekers, or who should pay for their upkeep.?This law was written for another time. Not only do these ?migrants? come from ?every hellhole in Africa?, one of the interviewed migrants was a Bangladeshi. ?The truth is that the world is full of far more victims of wars, violence, bad governments and political repression than we can ever take in.? That is the truth with the world?s over-populated nations expecting their ?surplus? can head to Europe and North America. I remember the stories of refugee camps in Eritrea during an earlier famine. More babies were born there to offset the overall death rate. With no access to, nor concept of, family planning or fertily control, there will be more misery, more malnutrition, more people getting into leaky boats. The UNHCR has organized programs to remove refugees from over-populated trouble spots before ... but this has NOT reduced, prevented nor improved the situation in any of those zones. Here is the UNHCR's most recent disheartening data on the refugee crisis: http://unhcr.org/globaltrendsjune2013/UNHCR%20GLOBAL%20TRENDS%202012_V08_web.pdf An estimated 45.2-million people were displaced in one year (2012 - 2013), rising since 1994. Where did refugees comes from at the end of 2012 (that's ONE year's data), and in what numbers? Afghanistan 2,585,600; Somalia 1,136,100; Iraq 746, 400; Syria 728, 500; Sudan 569, 200; Democratic Republic of Congo 509, 400; Mynamar 415, 300; Colombia 394, 100;Vietnam 336, 900; Eritrea 285, 100. Many of these areas disdain western values -- how would they adapt to being 'transplanted'? Look to Holland's experience, and the resulting changes to its immigration and refugee programs. These data also identify internally displaced persons (IDPs) not yet counted as refugees. The number of IDPs was at the highest level in over 20 years, with the war in Syria leading to 4.25-million Syrian IDPs. The UNHCR was developed in 1951 to assist with the absorption of far smaller numbers of refugees. The world has changed. It is no longer possible to remove an entire chunk of a nation's people to foreign nations where they do not share the values of the host country. It is time to direct MORE effort and funds at setting up protected settlements and education programs in the same areas from which refugees hail. Why isn't the UN pressuring its own members to stop the wars within their nations?

As much as I feel sorry for many of the refugees who want to flee for a better life, I believe Europe allowing them to stay would be a bad idea. The Southern European countries they are arriving in are already facing many issues and don't have the ability to cope financially while in the Northern European countries are seeing far right parties doing increasing well in recent elections and my worry is if they take too many this might allow one of those to actually win and the damage that would cause doesn't make it worth it. I hate to say it but Europeans are considerably less tolerant than Canadians thus the reason for the negative backlash. I know some on the board may dislike, but perhaps Canada could take some but off course they should be screened heavily and only those who are genuine refugees, not economic ones would get to come here. Those who are economic ones can return home and apply like everyone else and will be decided whether they get enough points or not on whether they can come here.

Any observations re: over-population, Doug? The U.N. estimates there are currently 54-million refugees and displaced persons 'on the move'. Here are the UN's numbers from 2012-2013, and the origins for those refugees: Afghanistan 2,585,600; Somalia 1,136,100; Iraq 746, 400; Syria 728, 500; Sudan 569, 200; Democratic Republic of Congo 509, 400; Mynamar 415, 300; Colombia 394, 100;Vietnam 336, 900; Eritrea 285, 100. Many of these areas disdain western values -- how would they adapt to being 'transplanted'? Europe, North America has coordinated these 'rescue efforts' with the UN before. What happens? Another decade passes, and there are even MORE refugees than the last time. All these 'rescue efforts' by the UN have not eliminated, reduced or improved the problem that is driving these crises over and over: over-population, which results in depleted resources, civil strife, war, hunger, poverty, etc. It seems to be a never-ending cycle, and for some reason, Europe and North America are supposed to support all these 'refugees', even though jobs have been disappearing for two decades. . It is time to direct all effort and funds at setting up protected settlements and education programs in the same areas from which refugees hail. Make it clear to these refugees that they will be accommodated within their own regions, NOT elsewhere. Why isn't the UN pressuring its own members to stop the wars within their national borders? Education is the KEY, though we sometimes see it working in reverse to produce such violent trouble-making groups as ISIS, which accepts international converts to its death cult. This is a prime example of what may happen when western nations try to absorb large refugee influxes ... along with the 'influences' that caused their exodus in the first place.

Immigrants / refugees from Africa / Middle East are reproducing at double or triple that rate. They are often unemployed and living off welfare, their birthrate supported by tax dollars.

?This summer the tiny, idyllic Greek island of Lesbos is being swamped with boats from Turkey, which lies just a few miles across the water. They overflow with people who come from Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea. Some are upper middle-class mothers from Damascus with their kids, fleeing the Syrian civil war. Some are young African men, lured by northern Europe?s streets of gold.?That list of countries certainly resembles the comprehensive list issued by the UNHCR at the beginning of 2013: an estimated 45.2-million people were displaced in one year (2012 - 2013), and that number has risen since 1994. Where did refugees comes from at the end of 2012 (that's ONE year's data), and in what numbers? Afghanistan 2,585,600; Somalia 1,136,100; Iraq 746, 400; Syria 728, 500; Sudan 569, 200; Democratic Republic of Congo 509, 400; Mynamar 415, 300; Colombia 394, 100;Vietnam 336, 900; Eritrea 285, 100. Many of these areas disdain western values -- how would they adapt to being 'transplanted'? Look to Holland's experience, and the resulting changes to its immigration and refugee programs. The Syrian crisis has been highlighted in the UNHCR's latest report as 'a major new factor in global displacement'. 55% of refugees listed in the report come from five countries affected by war; Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq, Syria and Sudan. The current U.N. estimate of ?displaced persons?, or refugees fleeing Africa, Asia and the Middle East, is 55-million. The number just keeps rising for one reason: human over-population continues in all those nations where too many humans have stripped the finite resources and landscapes. Despite the on-going strife and its obvious causes, very few of these people want to change their beliefs and customs; yet, they are ready to force their way into Britain by why of the Calais tunnel. Time for Europeans to unite against this growing problem, instead of bickering about how refugees each should take this time ... encouraging even more to come. The UNHCR has organized programs to remove refugees from various trouble spots in the world before ... but this has not yet ever reduced, prevented or improved the situation in any of those zones. That?s why the numbers keep growing, and they keep coming. . It is time to direct MORE effort and funds at setting up protected settlements and education programs in the same areas from which refugees hail, and this is especially requires wealthy nations, such as Saudi Arabia, to take in refugees from that area of the world. Why isn't the UN pressuring its own members to stop the wars within their nations? For TOO long, western nations have been viewed as the ?salve? and ?relief valve? for the over-population problems of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Now, it is time for them to sort out their own problems, which in many cases, stem from their own belief systems. Europe needs to unite and resurrect & enforce their borders now, more than ever.

I don't mind that Europe will be swallowed up by Africans, Middle Easterners, south Asians and Papuans. After all, Europe sat on the neck of the rest of the continents and throttled them by the neck for a few centuries. The only thing I wish would not go away are blue eyes and blonde and red hair. Blue eyes are a rarity in other indigenous races, but blonde and red hair is unique to Europea Caucasians. And very fair skin. These are going to be a loss, not as in a loss of 'supreme colour' but as a loss in diversity. Other than that, I maintain that a human being is a human being is a human being.

G&M. This is Canada. You're failing in your role in holding OUR government to account. Some truths for Canadians. The Harper government first said, they'd bring in 10,000 Syrian refugees. Then again during this election, they added another 10,000. They have brought in no more than approximately 2,000. And are far too reticent to be honest about progress. Why lack of progress? They're willing to accept only certain religions. And it's they that have an Office of Religious Freedom? Shame. They have made serious cutbacks at the offices that provide visas. That's the most serious road block of all. The government should provide support itself. Private groups are floundering. Their is no central leadership from the government. Is there even a will there? Evidence suggests not. Harper yesterday tied the refugee problem to two years ago, when IS became a serious issue. He's using the refugees to justify his war. Shame. And says war is the solution. It clearly is NOT. Shame again. As usual the Conservatives are ignorant of history. Assad is not ISIS and he has be destroying his cities indiscriminately, killing hundreds of thousands, and displacing millions. There are now approximately 10 million. IS is a result of Assad. Not the cause of refugees! G&M. May I remind you. Your job is to inform Canadians about CANADA. Your job in a democracy is to hold governments to account, to provide openness. Not to prop up a government that doesn't believe in doing anything but cutting taxes for the wealthy.

Exactly how is this a European crisis - no one ever answers this other than saying....well their here and here's where they're trying to go? A couple unpleasant facts for you I) The vast majority of the 'migrants' are not from Syria they are from African Nations and are economic in nature (my favourite article was about the three 'migrants' from Vietnam caught sneaking across from Calais...). Your own article, currently on your homepage corroborates the nature and breakdown of the migrants. Secondly, they're also overwhelming young men 15-35 years of age but for whatever mysterious reason it's really difficult to get the actual numbers. So, clearly these people felt comfortable enough leaving the women and their kids somewhere while they could go put down roots over an X-year period. Third - given that a large number of these people come from muslim nations why is it that Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, UAE i.e. the richest muslim nations have taken in exactly ZERO migrants? Please provide some form of balanced journalism with at least cogent arguments as opposed to crap PC perspective pieces. These people are suffering and the European elite flushing them into their labour pool to compensate for low birth rates isn't the solution.

I completely agree with your post. Saudi Arabia, one of the richest countries in the world (& Muslim) should be taking the lead in the middle east and taking in these refugees. While all humans can have empathy/sympathy to the refugees, and Canadians have always helped out others in need, Canada should NOT be taking in 10-25,000 refugees as the NDP, Liberals would do. Yes, provide some funding/supplies to help out but we have many other problems in Canada that require our attention. Unemployment is rising, our Environment, First Nations stilling in horrible conditions despite mega dollars being spent on them and on and on.

First, G.W. Bush destroys, invades, destroys and occupies Iraq supported by the Brits and others. Canada and many other countries invade and occupy Afghanistan.

Excellent editorial. If the photo of the young person washed up on the beach doesn't move you then, we can't agree on much of anything. Canada is a very prosperous country relative to just about a handful of other first world countries. The refugee crises impacting Europe has been poorly administered. Of course it does not affect Canada directly but with the Internet, daily dispatches and horrible photography we get a clearer representation of the crisis. Canada and Canadians proved their generosity during the Vietnamese boat crisis back in the early 80's. We haven't done much, morally as a country we should open our wallets and homes to these refugees. My orthopaedic surgeon was a refugee from Vietnam. His parents brought his family to Canada back in 1982 and have contributed and subsequently prospered since.

Comparing the EU refugee crisis to Canada's legal immigration process is deeply fallacious reasoning. Most legal immigrants to Canada already speak at least one of our national languages, and (for most forms of immigration) must prove that they are worth having here in terms of age, education, job skills, etc. 300, 000 people who are bringing with them little more than the clothes on their backs, have no money, don't speak the languages of Europe, and most importantly are just showing up with no orderly process whatsoever create a tremendous burden. Frankly, I think Europe is at the edge of a tremendous precipice and it's going to take a monumental social and political and social effort to save the continent from being overrun over the next century as its own populations are stagnant while the populations in Africa and the Middle East are exploding. It may well be that this century will mark the end of Western European civilization. It happened to Rome.

Turkey also has a long time history and deems the Kurdish / Turkish refuges as separatist / terrorist organization. So people should lay the blame where it rightfully belongs ...the geopolitical failure at the United Nations and the humanitary failure of both Russian and Chinese citizens and their lack of humanitarian leadership on this planet earth. Question....why are Russian military, Chinese military advisors and Iranian military actively fighting in Syria now yet everyone condems Western involvement.....ANSWER depends what political side you want to promote but presenting preferred facts and one sided blame is suspicious and spurious.

Sweden is one example and how things would work out there would not necessarily how things would work out here. She muddles her argument by conflating a variety of issues that are particular to a leftist welfare state. In addition, do realise that one cannot ascribe certain traits (labelling) to group as random as immigrants. Immigrants are just people and among a variety of people, some would be misfits. This is true of the random group of white people of 'our Canadian culture' as well- remember that Justin Bourque, Marc Lepine, Robert Picton were not immigrants- thankfully their traits are not ascribed to all non-immigrants. Finally, remember, Canada has an ageing population and is in need of immigrants to sustain ourselves.

You can sense a political motive behind this alarmist column.

Mr. Crosby said in 2013...' Have two well known conservative columnist been summoned to duty, to help 'reach' the 'key voters' with a 'message that connects with them'?If this scenario is true, the message is clearly to be 'fear immigration'. Blatchford's let-them-all-in column is then a diversionary lightning rod to stoke anger. In essence then, Christy is sacrificing herself to self-enflamed anger of the targeted voter. Did anybody else see Blatchford's column coming? Closing comments to it does nothing to allay skepticism. While Wente here, presents a scantily backed, seemingly reasoned, argument bordering on the recommending the exact opposite as Blatchford does; a much more palatable opinion for the targeted supporter, or 'the base'. The base now lightly armed with dubious stats can justify the simmering anger, and hopefully are mobilised to vote.(It always struck me as strange, this affectionate embrace of the term 'the base' the Conservatives have: a name proudly used by a murderous terrorist organisation. I wonder if Jenni Byrne ever noticed that.)The strategy of the CPC, then is to double down, in effect, on their appeal to their supporters, using their baser emotions as the lever. Or as Crosby reportedly admonishing a previous Conservative client in an election campaign, concentrate on the traditional supporter, quit chasing those you can get marginal support from ( Crosby put it in a much cruder way... i want to get this comment past the moderator, so i won't use Crosby's reported words).If the answer to my questions are yes, and my scenario is right, the Conservative can only be successful if the 'fear the immigration ' message resonates deeply enough to convince the entire faction base of the dire necessity to vote, thereby getting the absolute maximum turn out. They have to hope those plus just s a few less ardent party supporters attracted to other angles of their platform, garners enough votes to put them over the top. The lower the total voter turnout the better for the Tories. Here advantages accrued by voter suppression measures can only be seen a beneficial. The Orwellian named, Fair Election Act , written and backed by only one of the parties in Parliament comes clearly into focus.

Okay, hold on to your butts, cause shits about to break loose. 

The Spanish flu actually started in Americas mid west. It just got its name because every country was embroiled in WWI and heavily censored. Spain was the only country with actual press freedom, and they openly reported on the illness.

Anyway, that particular strain of the flu came to Phillys naval yard in September of 1918. Within days, 600 sailors were ill. 

There was a push for the city to align with jingoistic nationalism and have a parade down Broad Street  the Liberty Loan Parade. They didnt have a war industry yet, so in every way, every American individual had to directly support the war effort, and if you didnt, you were a total piece of shit.

Against all medical advice, the parade went on. 200,000 people packed Broad Street. Shoulder to shoulder. Breathing on each other. 

Within 72 hours, every one of Philadelphias 31 hospital beds were filled. A week out, people were laying corpses on the sidewalk for pickup. On one day  October 12th 728 people died of influenza in Philly. It a record that STILL hasnt been surpassed.

They chose to kill over that.\n\nthis was not what the war was about. i see you attempted to understand so i'll explain further. in the 50s, information did not flow like it did today. nobody in the south truly knew what communists were like. when ho chi minh retreated to the north, he left thousands of communist cells in the south to influence and kill oppositions. they did what all communist uprisings did, they went around lying to the have nots about how much better their lives would be if they rose up and took assets from the haves through any means necessary. so in the country side they were killing people all over. meanwhile, the majority of southerners didn't know. they were just rumors in the wind. that's why southerners were not galvanized to fight the \""vietnam war.\"" so when americans stepped in, it seemed like americans were dragging south vietnam into a war. if southerners knew the true nature of communism and what their lives would become after a communist take over, there is no way they wouldn't fight.\n\nlook at vietnam today as a communist state. it's poor and people are oppressed. so was the war about economic and cultural differences? no it's about being able to live freely and to have social mobility. both severely lacking in vietnam today. \n\ni'm sorry but you kids have been lied to with regards to the vietnam war. i see a lot of misinformation about it on reddit these days. it could be propaganda puppets trying to make usa look bad. the best example of what such a war could accomplish is to look at the differences between north and south korea today. ask any vietnamese living in vietnam today, would they rather be living in a communist state or a democracy. the answer is obvious. was the vietnam war worth it? it would've been if the south had won just like it's worth it for south korea. again, the people of south vietnam today would have a decent living standard and would be mostly free.\n\nliterally anyone who is arguing with me about this are people are simply read a few posts on reddit and thought they understood what it was all about. take a step back and think about it. you're talking about communists. i'm starting to think most of you don't even understand what it's about. you think it's an economic system. it's actually a system for governance.  so stop bringing up the word capitalism, it isnt communism vs capitalism. it's communism vs democracy. communism is an excuse to trick people into surrendering power to an elite class with absolute power. it's a political system.",jje,test_id_153

Okay, hold on to your butts, cause shits about to break loose. 

The Spanish flu actually started in Americas mid west. It just got its name because every country was embroiled in WWI and heavily censored. Spain was the only country with actual press freedom, and they openly reported on the illness.

Anyway, that particular strain of the flu came to Phillys naval yard in September of 1918. Within days, 600 sailors were ill. 

There was a push for the city to align with jingoistic nationalism and have a parade down Broad Street  the Liberty Loan Parade. They didnt have a war industry yet, so in every way, every American individual had to directly support the war effort, and if you didnt, you were a total piece of shit.

Against all medical advice, the parade went on. 200,000 people packed Broad Street. Shoulder to shoulder. Breathing on each other.

People want to support liberal values, but they look at our side and they see a bunch of people arguing that protestors who vandalize federal property should be immune to arrest, and they think, ""Wow, I'm not going to sign up with *those* lunatics.""

I'm not talking about what's right and wrong. I'm talking about what makes for a persuasive argument. Can we point to anyone who has actually been arrested by a federal agency for *not* violating a federal law? If so, we have a case.

He already says he doesn't believe the news. And that he is the reason we've had 'such a good response' to the coronavirus. He held daily press conferences for months to cover up the fact that he fubar'd the coronavirus response. 

>Does media pander him or does media critize him on every turn? 

He constantly calls the media the 'enemy of the people' and look at what happened as soon as the protests started, _police started shooting and arresting news personnel_.

>Does he have special Trump units which take care of his opposition? 

William Barr.

>Does he have ultimate power to decide your fate with no consequences from his opposition, because in dictatorship there is no opposition?

He has pardoned everyone that he favors and he has fired everyone who stops even an inch out of line. 

>Do you see Americans being massively dragged into prison camps, because they are opposition to Trump?

At the rate that people see antifa as less than human, I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop. Or something like this is happen.

No, you're trying to use a situation that is insufficient justifaction for most people to kill to criticize people who support the right to civilian gun ownership; that's dumb. YOU are capable of killing; the fact that YOU are not means implicitly that you know that these arrests aren't adequate justification for most people to kill, so please be sincere. It's easy to tout your supposed/unrealistic ideology when you only apply it to people you disagree with; the bullshit that you're peddling about 2A supporters being the first to shoot is yours alone, and you can't force people who support the 2A to defend, embrace, or even bother to debate your absurd perspective.

Even if you don't like guns, you're still not renting a pickup truck to go mow down those responsible for these arrests (which neither of us agree with), hurling molotov cocktails, or buying a gun to kill them. You're criticizing people based on an absurd standard you don't even apply to youself (that I don't recommend anyone use or follow). Before most people would support killing in this situation, most would need to know more about why those people were arrested, what happened to them, and that we can't get justice for them through other nonviolent means (like the judicial system or the individual State Governments).

You're also incorrect for saying armed civilian defense or revolution never happens, or that ""they'll fold.""

The IRA/Independent Ireland, Vietcong/North Vietnamese, and Autonomous Region of Iraqi Kurdistan, the Taliban outlasting both Russia and US military intervention, 'Battle of Athens' (Tennesssee), and the 'Arab Spring' are all examples of *popular* armed civilian rebellions and their allies defeating more powerful government militaries or police forces. Thousands of people during pretty much any given time in history wouldn't be risking their lives to fight more powerful militaries if doing so wasn't often effective in achieving at least some of their goals. If a popular uprising against a tyrannical Government does become necessary, or even personal defense from an individual crime becomes necessary, the 2A helps ensure those with a legal right to own firearms are better able to defend themselves.

Any successful revolution needs *popular* support, so of course we don't want to see you, any other individual, or easily discredited group unilaterally commit a lone-wolf/fringe-group ideology act of terrorism (which honestly sounds like the straw man you've presented). That is not to say that one *justified* and *popularly supported* act of violence can't change the outcome of a revolution, but what you're proposing in this specific instance and juncture is stupid.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otoya_Yamaguchi

Clearly, there are risks, downsides, and restrictions to civilian gun ownership, but those are a lot more nuanced debates and concerns than what you're putting forth (which just boils down to 'why don't you try and draw and shoot fist, pussy! Huh?! Huh! Huh, unless you're a pussy!').

So what do I, an individual person who believes in freedom, do? Do I roll into Chicago with my AR and a bag of bullets? What then? I load it and immediately get arrested for knowingly breaking the law. Maybe I get sneaky and sit on a roof top with my bolt action. Shoot a federal cop who's arresting a protester. What do I do then? I get fucking killed by the federal swat team. Pro 2A people are not as organized as you're implying. And there is not organization out there that I would support with violent action. What am I supposed to do?

No attention.


How do you mean? Fox News pretty much covered the looting 24 x 7 for 2 weeks straight.

CNN, MSNBC, ABC all covered the looting the rioting and the damages caused by it. They all did heart string pieces with people whose property was vandalized or destroyed.

So what do you mean no attention?. In this case, do you mean the story shouldnt be about the federal police are being used and suddey normalized? But that it should be more about the looting? 

Are you also implying that people SHOULDNT be at Least interested in learning about this sudden use of federal paramilitary police forces in american cities, against local authorities wishes? A blatant display of the federal government over reaching its powers and stripping the states of their rights and autonomy? People SHOULDNT be interested in learning about this new Force that is being employed around the country? Is that what you mean? Because to me it sounds like the sort of thing a country thats goose stepping its way into fascism would do. 

I feel like people SHOULD be hearing about it all of this and talking to everyone they know about it because the next parts all happen very fast. Dont you think people should know about that kind of stuff?

> Why wouldn't they identify themselves though ?

You do realize that Trump and his GOP friends want to start violence.  They want to have someone fight back, or try to stop from being kidnapped, so they can use it as an excuse to say the protesters are violent.  Violence benefits Trump and the GOP and will help them steal the election in November.   

These are desperate men trying to hold on to power. They will make billions if they can keep Trump in the White House.   

This is the party that wants to prevent as many people as they can from voting.  They passed laws that if there were any mistakes or differences in your name on public records, then you could not vote.  So someone in the system as John Smith and John T. Smith was automatically banned from voting.

Youre quoting me factually, but failing to understand the quote  

How many troops did New Zealand have in North Africa?

When the US invaded Afghanistan several countries joined us. Including Romania, with less than 2000 troops. Let's talk about their significant role in Afghanistan.

Canada was busy fighting in Europe and wasn't involved in the Pacific  

New Zealand also had a very minor role. As in they only defended themselves from invasion. 

Britain was not involved in the Pacific. They were fight in Europe. 

India, since it was a British Colony sent soldiers to fight in Europe. But did see some fighting in Burma.

Philippines, US territory. 

Malaya was defensive, not offensive. 

Fiji was chosen by the Americans as a base. The Fijians were used primarily as scouts. (Learned that just now)

Burma was also primarily offensive. 

France and the Netherlands were absolutely not involved in the Pacific. 

Thailand, Korea, China, Vietnam, all were occupied by Japan during the war and did not play a major role in breaking Japan's back. 


Not once did I say the USA fought completely by themselves. But they were by far the largest contributor to defeating Japan. The war was over for Japan as soon as we entered the war.
