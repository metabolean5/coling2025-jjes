# COLING 2025 synthetic jjes

This repository contains the dataset used for the "Enhancing Discourse Parsing for Local Structures from Social Media with LLM-Generated Data" COLING 2025 main conference paper.
The dataset contains 1,170 local RST discourse structures, including 900 synthetic examples and 270 gold examples. These examples cover three social media platforms: online news comment sections (from the Globe and Mail Canadadian newspaper website), a discussion forum (Reddit), and a social media messaging platform (Twitter).

The particular RST discourse structur consists of the arrangement of JOINT JOINT EVALUATION (JJE) coherence relations, which mimics a logical-argumentative flow by presenting a series of implicitly related statements, leading to a climactic statement.

This repo can be used to reproduce the results obtained the paper. It can also be used to further study JJE structures or polarization phenomena on social media.
